# Deployment Readout — AI Bradaa Strategic Command

**Prepared for**: Executive Board (10)  
**Compiled by**: Syeddy Orchestrator via AI POD outputs  
**Date**: 23-Oct-2025 (Asia/Kuala_Lumpur)

---

## 1. Scope & Objectives

- Phase covered: Steps 1–5 of homepage stabilization and AI data pipeline refresh.  
- Key focus: AI adapter centralization, dataset resilience, homepage UX anchors, deterministic artifacts, and validation scaffolding.

---

## 2. Implementation Highlights

- **Step 1** — `ai_pod/adapters/aiClient.js`, `netlify/functions/ai.*`, `app/js/aipod/provider-proxy.js`: Introduced mock-aware AI adapter with safe Netlify proxy fallback (no key spam).
- **Step 2** — `app/index.v15.2.html`, `src/scripts/api.js`: Unified laptop data loading from `/data/laptops.json` + fallback with schema awareness and metadata tracking.
- **Step 3** — `app/index.v15.2.html`: Reworked nav anchors into smooth-scroll buttons, improved section targeting, respected `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Step 4** — `reports/audit/inventory.json`, `reports/datasets.determinism.json`: Refreshed dataset references, recorded SHA-256 hashes for JSON datasets.
- **Step 5** — No additional scripts authored; existing testing harnesses inventoried for follow-up automation.

---

## 3. Verification Summary

- Linting / Tests: None executed automatically during these steps (manual validation pending).  
- Determinism: `reports/datasets.determinism.json` hashes rechecked on 24-Oct-2025 via PowerShell `Get-FileHash`; values align with `reports/audit/inventory.json`.  
- Performance: Lighthouse harness (`tests/perf/run-lh.mjs`) ready; no new run captured during Step 4.

---

## 4. Outstanding Follow-up

- Formal Playwright smoke and security checks to be scripted (future work item).  
- Execute Lighthouse + capture metrics for Step 4 artifacts when data finalized.  
- Consider deduplicating normalization logic into shared module (inventory note).

---

## 5. Distribution Notes

- Malaysia-first timestamping and PDPA posture maintained; no secrets committed.  
- All AI-visible strings remain sourced via AI POD or existing tokens.  
- Safe to circulate to Executive Board for approval and mentorship review.
